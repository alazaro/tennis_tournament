Tournaments
===========

Django application made to help manage a tennis tournament.

Demo
----

There is a demo of this application in http://torneos.alazaro.es

The administration page is http://torneos.alazaro.es/admin
User: demo
Password: demo

Background
----------

Before making this application, people phoned the tournament managers to ask
when they played and who was their opponent. That was the reason for this.
People can enter the application, fill in their license number and then they
will know everything they need. Simple but useful.

Why open source?
----------------

This is a very simple app that can be used as a demo app. It is prepared to
run on Google App Engine. Or maybe you want to improve it or modify it.
Feel free to do it.

Dependencies
------------

All of its dependencies are in the repository. These need to be there in
order to run in GAE. They are pretty sure outdated. Feel free to update
them and send a pull request!
However, you may need PIL and a database driver.

License
-------

This application is distributed under GPLv3 License. Feel free to modify it or
distribute it, but keep this license and please link this repo.

Thanks.
